### Hello!

**This is a selection of recipes curated by me, these have been tested to make sure they are camp-compatible, easy to cook, and easy to clean!**
This was mainly created since I do a lot of stove-cooking when scouting, and some of the stuff I've made have been decent. Some of these recipes are adapted
whilst others are completely original.
Campfire recipes are in a different section.

**All recipes include name of dish, a short description of the dish, ingredients and instructions to prepare.**

#### **Method and Instruction**
a. **Preparation**
1.	Wash all vegetables and mushrooms, make sure frozen ingredients (if any) are thawed out.
2.	Chopping & Prep
    - Chop the core off the Shimeji and then separate the mushroom.
    - Cut bacon into bite-sized pieces.
    - Trim your asparagus and cut into 1” pieces.

b. **Cooking**

1.	Heat olive oil in a medium pot on medium high heat until shimmering. Add garlic, onion, bacon, asparagus, and mushrooms. Stir fry until bacon is lightly browned and the vegetables are softened, about 8-10 minutes. Blot the bacon fat using a paper towel if you feel it is too greasy.
2.	Add water and a quarter of a Consommé cube. Dissolve into the water and bring to a boil. Taste soup for seasoning, adding more if necessary.
3.	Add spaghetti, breaking it in half to allow it to fit in the pot. 
4.	Cook, stirring occasionally, for about half the recommended cooking time of the spaghetti you are using, or until the water is nearly soaked up.
5.	Add milk and return to a boil. Stir occasionally and simmer until the pasta is cooked through. The liquid should be thickened and will easily coat the pasta. Add a dash of milk or water only if your pasta is not cooked through and the pasta is sticking to the bottom of the pot.
6.	Remove from heat and add cheese in a single layer on top. Let rest for a moment to melt before stirring to incorporate. 
7.	Top with ground black pepper and a sprinkling of parsley and serve hot.

### **_Purin_**

##### _Serves 4/makes 4 individual-sized purin_

| Ingredient      | Quantity | Remarks                |
|-----------------|----------|------------------------|
| **FOR CUSTARD** |          |                        |

| Sugar           | 5 tbsp   |                        |
| Eggs            | 2-3      | depending on size      |
| Vanilla Extract | ¼ tsp    | optional               |
| **FOR CARAMEL** |          |                        |
| Sugar           | 4 tbsp   |                        |
| Water           | 1 tbsp   |                        |
| Hot Water       | 1½ tbsp  |                        |
| EXTRA           |          |                        |
| Unsalted Butter | -        | for greasing moulds    |

#### **Method and Instruction**
a. **Preparation (Caramel)**
1.	Lightly butter the inside of 4 purin moulds.
2.	Place sugar and water in a saucepan. Bring to a simmer on medium heat until the sugar melts and is dissolved into the water. 
3.	Continue heating until the sugar turns a deep amber colour, being careful not to burn the caramel.
4.	Remove caramel from the heat and, using a long handled spoon or ladle, carefully add hot water to the caramel in 2 – 3 small portions. Swirl the contents of the pot together to incorporate the water into the caramel. 
Be careful of hot caramel splashing up during this step, as it can cause burns.
5.	Evenly distribute caramel among the 4 moulds. Set aside.

b. **Preparation (Custard)**

6.	To prepare the steaming environment for the purin: Fill a pot with a fitted lid with enough water so that the bottom half of the cups are covered when placed into the water. Place a small, clean dishcloth or towel at the bottom of the pot to help distribute the heat evenly. Bring to a low boil.
7.	Place milk and sugar in a small pot set on medium heat. 
8.	Stir occasionally until the sugar has completely dissolved and the milk is hot and steaming.
9.	Whisk eggs in a bowl until the yolks are well incorporated into the whites. Try not to produce too many bubbles or mix a lot of air into the eggs. 
10.	Slowly pour the hot milk into the eggs, whisking vigorously as you pour, being careful not to scramble the eggs. Ensure the eggs and milk are incorporated together completely.
11.	Strain the egg mixture using a fine meshed strainer and remove any foam from its surface using a spoon. 
12.	Gently pour egg mixture evenly into each mould with the caramel sauce at the bottom. Cover securely with foil.

c. **Cooking**

13.	Gently place the custard in the prepared steaming environment. Cover the pot with a lid and cook, making sure the water remains just below the boiling point. 
14.	Steam for 15 – 20 minutes, or until the top of the custard has solidified and is shiny, and the purin wiggles slightly in its mould when gently shaken. 
15.	Remove from hot water and let cool to room temperature, keeping the foil covering the moulds. 
16.	Refrigerate until thoroughly chilled, about 2 hours.

d. **To serve**

17.	Run the tip of a thin knife along the top edge of the custard. Hold the mould at an angle and gently tap against a hard surface, turning it slowly to loosen the custard from the mould on all sides.
18.	Turn the mould upside down on a serving plate. The purin should pop out of the mould, landing with the caramel facing up. Tap the bottom of the mould if it does not come out. 
Be gentle with the purin as it is very soft and a bit fragile once removed from its mould.
19.	Serve as a sweet snack or dessert.
