## Koten-Bu (Classic Literature Club Series)
Originally published in 2001, the Koten-Bu Series was written by Honobu Yonezawa, with Hyouka (氷菓) being the first volume of the series.

A fan-translation was started of the series in its 6 volume entirety at Baka-Tsuki.
The .pdf and .epub versions cut off at Volume 2, so I decided to create .pdf and .epub versions from Volume 3 onward.

**I kindly request you to not re-distribute them from this site without prior expressed permission, to prevent loss of attribution.**

All credits go to the original author, publisher and translators at Baka-Tsuki.
You can find the original plain-text and pdfs/epubs [here](https://www.baka-tsuki.org/project/index.php?title=Hyouka).
