## Trapeze Intelligent Transport Systems
![Screenshot 2024-09-14 231210](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/484dfc59-8958-4ac5-89b1-90b93809911d)

A virtual recreation of Trapeze Transport systems in Lua in Roblox.

Fully customisable, relatively efficient, and very user-friendly too, integrates with a Stop Reporter System (and preferably also a ticketing system in the near future).
Currently not a final product, as I am not content with the way some of the features are, and the Past/Upcoming stops on the Trapeze will also be updated to more accurately reflect that of the real life one.

Based heavily off the Trapeze IP-Terminal IPT and the Common Fleet Management System for LTA.

## Koten-Bu (Classic Literature Club Series)
Originally published in 2001, the Koten-Bu Series was written by Honobu Yonezawa, with Hyouka (氷菓) being the first volume of the series.

A fan-translation was started of the series in its 6 volume entirety at Baka-Tsuki.
The .pdf and .epub versions cut off at Volume 2, so I decided to create .pdf and .epub versions from Volume 3 onward.

**I kindly request you to not re-distribute them from this site without prior expressed permission, to prevent loss of attribution.**

All credits go to the original author, publisher and translators at Baka-Tsuki.
You can find the original plain-text and pdfs/epubs [here](https://www.baka-tsuki.org/project/index.php?title=Hyouka).
