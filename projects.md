## Trapeze Intelligent Transport Systems (ROBLOX .lua)
![Screenshot 2024-09-14 231210](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/484dfc59-8958-4ac5-89b1-90b93809911d)

A virtual recreation of Trapeze Transport systems in Lua in Roblox.

**ℹ️ Info:**
Fully customisable, relatively efficient, and very user-friendly too, integrates with a Stop Reporter System and Fare Collection system (and preferably also a ticketing system in the near future).
Currently not a final product, as I am not content with the way some of the features are, and I believe there is much more room for optimisation.

Mostly based off of Trapeze's Intelligent Transport Systems (ITS).
Driver control module based off of Trapeze's Intelligent Touch Terminal (ITT).
Passenger Display modules are based off of Bravo/Citybus, just without the Chinese.

**📶 Stats:**
about 3-4 days with 2 hours each day.
Not very experienced with coding in .lua since I normally stick to building.
Scripts are still in the process of being optimised.

**📃Script:**
Totals up to 6 unique scripts.
- 1 main "handler" script that handles ALL modules within the system. (~35 lines)
- 3 ITT driver control module scripts. (~190 lines total)
  - 1 main "control" script that performs actions based on changes in a set of values.
  - 2 scripts to update these values based on user input.
- 1 passenger info display script (~20 lines)
  - Passenger info displays are handled in their independent script since a lot of calculations are made based off of the part the display is on, such that it is       dynamically adjusted.
  - 1 card reader script (~50 lines)
    - Detects a tool and performs mathematical operations.

## Koten-Bu (Classic Literature Club Series)
Originally published in 2001, the Koten-Bu Series was written by Honobu Yonezawa, with Hyouka (氷菓) being the first volume of the series.

A fan-translation was started of the series in its 6 volume entirety at Baka-Tsuki.
The .pdf and .epub versions cut off at Volume 2, so I decided to create .pdf and .epub versions from Volume 3 onward.

All credits go to the original author, publisher and translators at Baka-Tsuki.
You can find the original plain-text and pdfs/epubs [here](https://www.baka-tsuki.org/project/index.php?title=Hyouka).
